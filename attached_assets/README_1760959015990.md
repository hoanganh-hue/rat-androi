## 🚀 About DogeRat (Web‑Admin)

DogeRat empowers you with fast, secure, and extensible control over Android devices **without relying on Telegram**.  
All commands are now executed through a modern web interface that supports role‑based access, audit logs, and real‑time device communication.

### Core Components
- **Server side** – Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, PostgreSQL (or MySQL)  
- **Web dashboard** – React / Vue (SPA) + TailwindCSS  
- **Android client** – Kotlin‑based APK (unchanged)

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** ≥ 18  
- **Docker & Docker‑Compose** (recommended)  
- **PostgreSQL** ≥ 15 (or MySQL)  

### Quick start with Docker

```bash
# 1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your‑org/dogerat-web.git
cd dogerat-web

# 2️⃣ Create environment file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env → set DB credentials, JWT_SECRET, FRONTEND_URL, etc.

# 3️⃣ Build and run
docker compose up -d --build

# 4️⃣ Create admin user
docker-compose exec server node scripts/create-admin.js --username=admin --password=<your-secure-password>

# 5️⃣ Access the dashboard
http://localhost:8080   # default admin UI port
```

### Production Deployment with Ngrok

For production deployment with public access via ngrok:

```bash
# 1️⃣ Configure production environment
cp server/env.example .env
# Edit .env with production values (see PRODUCTION.md)

# 2️⃣ Deploy with ngrok integration
./deploy-production.sh

# 3️⃣ Access via public URL
https://choice-swine-on.ngrok-free.app
```

📖 **See [PRODUCTION.md](./PRODUCTION.md) for detailed production deployment guide.**

⚠️ **Current Status**: Application is 85% complete and ready for deployment. Docker registry connectivity issues may prevent immediate deployment. See [DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for alternative deployment methods.

### Manual (no Docker)

```bash
# Server
cd server
npm ci
npm run migrate   # create DB tables
npm start         # runs on PORT (default 3000)

# Admin UI
cd admin
npm ci
npm run dev      # vite dev server (http://localhost:5173)
```

> Remember to run the Android client (APK) on target devices – it will automatically connect to the server via Socket.IO.
