Translation: Comprehensively fix the following issues and understand the root causes.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Angular Client Compilation Errors

#### Issue 1.1: TS2554 - SocketService.connect() Parameter Mismatch
**Error:**
```
TS2554: Expected 0 arguments, but got 1.
  src/app/core/services/auth.service.ts:56:33
  src/app/core/services/auth.service.ts:80:35
```

**Root Cause:** 
The `SocketService.connect()` method was defined to take no parameters (it retrieves the token internally from AuthService), but `auth.service.ts` was calling it with a token parameter.

**Fix:**
- Modified `client/src/app/core/services/auth.service.ts` lines 56 and 80
- Changed from `this.socketService.connect(token)` to `this.socketService.connect()`

#### Issue 1.2: TS2339 - Missing AuditTrail Properties
**Error:**
```
TS2339: Property 'user_username' does not exist on type 'AuditTrail'.
TS2339: Property 'resource_type' does not exist on type 'AuditTrail'.
TS2339: Property 'details' does not exist on type 'AuditTrail'.
```

**Root Cause:**
The `AuditTrail` interface in `client/src/app/core/models/audit.model.ts` was missing properties that were being used in the `audit-list.component.ts`.

**Fix:**
- Added optional properties to AuditTrail interface:
  - `user_username?: string`
  - `resource_type?: string`
  - `details?: string`

#### Issue 1.3: TS7006 - Implicit 'any' Type
**Error:**
```
TS7006: Parameter 'update' implicitly has an 'any' type.
  src/app/pages/dashboard/dashboard.component.ts:292:71
```

**Root Cause:**
The `deviceStatusUpdates` Observable was missing from `SocketService`, and the subscription callback had an implicitly typed parameter.

**Fix:**
- Added `DeviceStatusUpdate` interface to `socket.service.ts`
- Added `deviceStatusUpdates` Observable to `SocketService`
- Imported and used `DeviceStatusUpdate` type in `dashboard.component.ts`

#### Issue 1.4: TS2339 - Missing deviceStatusUpdates Observable
**Error:**
```
TS2339: Property 'deviceStatusUpdates' does not exist on type 'SocketService'.
```

**Root Cause:**
The `SocketService` was missing the `deviceStatusUpdates` Observable that dashboard component was trying to subscribe to.

**Fix:**
- Added `DeviceStatusUpdate` interface
- Added `private deviceStatusSubject = new Subject<DeviceStatusUpdate>()`
- Added `public deviceStatusUpdates = this.deviceStatusSubject.asObservable()`
- Emit device status updates in `device-connected` and `device-disconnected` event handlers

#### Issue 1.5: SCSS - Undefined Function Error
**Error:**
```
✘ [ERROR] Undefined function.
   ╷
86 │ $dogerat-primary: mat.define-palette($dogerat-blue, 500, 700, 900);
   │                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   ╵
  src/theme.scss 86:19
```

**Root Cause:**
Angular Material v20 uses Material 3 (M3) design system, which deprecated the old `mat.define-palette()` function in favor of M3 theming or M2 compatibility mode.

**Fix:**
- Changed `mat.define-palette()` to `mat.m2-define-palette()`
- Changed `mat.define-dark-theme()` to `mat.m2-define-dark-theme()`
- Changed `mat.define-typography-config()` to `mat.m2-define-typography-config()`

#### Issue 1.6: NG8001 - Unknown Element 'mat-divider'
**Error:**
```
NG8001: 'mat-divider' is not a known element
  src/app/pages/devices/device-list/device-list.component.ts:161:16
  src/app/pages/users/user-list/user-list.component.ts:100:16
```

**Root Cause:**
The components were using `<mat-divider>` element but hadn't imported `MatDividerModule`.

**Fix:**
- Added `MatDividerModule` import to `device-list.component.ts`
- Added `MatDividerModule` import to `user-list.component.ts`

#### Issue 1.7: TS2322 - Type Mismatch in uniqueUsers()
**Error:**
```
TS2322: Type '(string | undefined)[]' is not assignable to type 'string[]'.
  src/app/pages/audit/audit-list/audit-list.component.ts:371:4
```

**Root Cause:**
The `user_username` property is optional (`string | undefined`), so mapping it creates an array that may contain undefined values.

**Fix:**
- Added `.filter((u): u is string => u !== undefined)` to filter out undefined values

#### Issue 1.8: Font Loading Errors
**Error:**
```
Failed to inline external stylesheet 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/...'
getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND fonts.googleapis.com
```

**Root Cause:**
The build environment has restricted network access and cannot reach fonts.googleapis.com.

**Fix:**
- Commented out external font URL imports in `client/src/styles.css`
- Added explanatory comments about network restrictions
- System fonts will be used as fallback

### 2. Server TypeScript Compilation Errors

#### Issue 2.1: Missing @types/node
**Error:**
```
error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'node'.
```

**Root Cause:**
The `@types/node` package was listed in tsconfig.json types array but not installed in the root package.json.

**Fix:**
- Installed `@types/node` as a dev dependency in root `package.json`

**Note:** The original error message mentioned decorator issues in Sequelize models, but these were actually not present when tested. The TypeScript configuration with `experimentalDecorators: true` and `emitDecoratorMetadata: true` is correct for sequelize-typescript.
